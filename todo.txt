I think that people might use this more often if there were user interactions. Reviews should probably be ranked whith the higher
rated reviews near the top. Users should also be able to comment on one anothers reviews. That'll give your site more interaction and
force participants to be more honest... Or atleast, the more honest reviews will rise to the top of the comments section. Let me know
what you guys think. I'll start looking into it if you all agree with my thoughts.
